			<h4></h4>

			<h4><span style="color: #d2492a;">Wood Gasification</span></h4>
			<p>Wood gasification is the most efficient process available for wood burning. Wood gas is generated in a high temperature reaction (&gt;700° F) between the wood and a limited amount of oxygen. The heat and lack of oxygen “bakes” the wood, causing the gases in the wood to be released.</p>
			<p>The wood gas mixture that is created in the firebox then gets forced through the base of the fire along with any ash that would come with it and burned at temperatures around 2000° F in the gasification chamber. This creates a very hot, very clean burn which helps you get the most out of your fuel. After the gas is burned, the heat is transferred to the water jacket using the heat exchange tubes. Normal exit temperatures of the exhaust are 200 – 300 F.</p>
			<p>The most notable indicator of effective gasification is the lack of smoke exiting the chimney.<br>
			The gasification process creates longer burn times and can reduce wood consumption as much as 50% compared to a standard wood furnace.</p>
			<h4><span style="color: #d2492a;">What does it mean for you?</span></h4>
			<ul>
			<li>Less wood cutting</li>
			<li>Less ash removal</li>
			<li>Fewer emissions</li>
			<li>Fewer trips to the furnace</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Bottom line – more heat for less</strong></p>

			<h4><span style="color: #d2492a;">Easy for You</span></h4>
			<ul>
			<li><b>Less wood cutting – </b>These high efficiency furnaces use up to 50% less wood than conventional furnaces, saving you time cutting and loading wood and cleaning ash.<b></b></li>
			<li><strong>EZ Clean Handle</strong> – Clean the heat exchange tubes quickly and easily and reduce maintenance time. No brushing tubes or scraping creosote!</li>
			<li><strong>Loading Switch</strong> – Reduces smoke when loading.</li>
			<li><b>Easy access hinged rear door</b> – The insulated rear door is built with a unique hinge design which allows for easy access to the rear of the furnace and quick and easy removal of the door if required without the use of tools or hardware.</li>
			<li><strong>Safe easy-to-use dual firebox door latch</strong> – Our carefully designed latch catches the door so it doesn’t swing completely open and expose you to excessive heat.</li>
			<li><strong>Water Level Gauge</strong> –&nbsp; That’s easy to read so you never have to worry about the status of the water</li>
			</ul>
						<h4><span style="color: #d2492a;">An Outdoor Wood Furnace that’s Built to Last</span></h4>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Titanium Stainless Steel</strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;Titanium enhanced&nbsp;and&nbsp;corrosion resistant, it is the only product that can provide the right blend of longevity, heat transfer&nbsp;and other critical traits that meet the HeatMaster<sup>SS</sup>&nbsp;standard of excellence.</li>
			<li><strong>HeatMaster<sup>ss</sup>&nbsp;warranty</strong>&nbsp;– We back each furnace with our best-in-industry Lifetime Limited Warranty which is twice as long as the leading mild steel competitor.&nbsp;It confirms our confidence in our products.</li>
			<li><b>Rounded firebox</b> –&nbsp;The rounded design gives the firebox more strength with fewer welds.</li>
			<li><strong>Draft Induction Fan</strong> – Draws air through the furnace to keep the airways clean.</li>
			<li><strong>ISO 9001 Certified&nbsp;</strong>– HeatMaster<sup>SS</sup>&nbsp;furnaces are built to the very highest manufacturing standards, employing top notch design and engineering.</li>
			<li><strong>Heavy duty multi-layer insulation – </strong>We feature a foil-backed insulation that won’t trap moisture, gives you high R values and has no seams for heat to escape.</li>
			<li><strong>Combustion Chamber</strong> – Our high efficiency chamber has a horseshoe refractory design to help create the cleanest, hottest burn.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4></h4>

			<h4><span style="color: #d2492a;">Wood Gasification</span></h4>
			<p>Wood gasification is the most efficient process available for wood burning. Wood gas is generated in a high temperature reaction (&gt;700° F) between the wood and a limited amount of oxygen. The heat and lack of oxygen “bakes” the wood, causing the gases in the wood to be released.</p>
			<p>The wood gas mixture that is created in the firebox then gets forced through the base of the fire along with any ash that would come with it and burned at temperatures around 2000° F in the gasification chamber. This creates a very hot, very clean burn which helps you get the most out of your fuel. After the gas is burned, the heat is transferred to the water jacket using the heat exchange tubes. Normal exit temperatures of the exhaust are 200 – 300 F.</p>
			<p>The most notable indicator of effective gasification is the lack of smoke exiting the chimney.<br>
			The gasification process creates longer burn times and can reduce wood consumption as much as 50% compared to a standard wood furnace.</p>
			<h4><span style="color: #d2492a;">What does it mean for you?</span></h4>
			<ul>
			<li>Less wood cutting</li>
			<li>Less ash removal</li>
			<li>Fewer emissions</li>
			<li>Fewer trips to the furnace</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Bottom line – more heat for less</strong></p>

      <p>A new design for our outdoor coal furnace,&nbsp;the C&nbsp;Series provides quality workmanship and materials with a design built for performance and efficiency. They&nbsp;work with almost any existing heating system and follow the HeatMaster<sup>ss</sup>&nbsp;<sup>&nbsp;</sup>standard for quality.&nbsp;Although they are very cost-effective, no shortcuts in quality were made in the production of these units.</p>

      <li><strong>Titanium Stainless Steel</strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;Titanium enhanced&nbsp;and&nbsp;corrosion resistant, it is the only product that can provide the right blend of longevity, heat transfer&nbsp;and other critical traits that meet the HeatMaster<sup>SS</sup>&nbsp;standard of excellence.</li>
      <li><strong>Heatmaster<sup>ss</sup>&nbsp;warranty</strong>&nbsp;– We back each furnace with our best-in-industry Lifetime Limited Warranty which is twice as long as the leading mild steel competitor.&nbsp;It confirms our confidence in our products.</li>
      <li><strong>Powder coat finish</strong>&nbsp;– Far more durable than paint and environmentally friendly.</li>
      <li><b>Rounded firebox</b>&nbsp;–&nbsp;The rounded design gives the firebox more strength with fewer welds, reducing the risks of cracks and leaks.&nbsp;The deep firebox of the C Series also works particularly well for&nbsp;an outdoor coal furnace.</li>
